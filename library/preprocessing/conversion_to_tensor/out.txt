 my, my, i was forgetting all about
the children and the mysterious fern seed. i wonder if it has changed
them back into real little children again. yes,
here they come.

oh, thank you, mr. wishing man. i feel ever so much better
now.

yes, indeed. my clothes are a perfect fit and nobody will laugh at me now.

i feel perfectly fan-tas-a-ma-gor-ious.

oh, see the pretty french dollies. i wish they would talk to me.

if that's your wish, they can.

can you talk?

pa-pa, pa-pa, pa-pa!

 and what can you say?

 ma-ma, ma-ma, ma-ma!

go on and talk to me.

mer-ry christ-mas! mer-ry christ-mas!

i wish you could wind them up so they could walk around and
play with us.

is that your wish?

oh, yes. do you think you can do it?

i can try.

pa-pa, pa-pa, pa-pa! 

here, stop her. she'll fall down.  here, turn
around. walk this way.

 ma-ma, ma-ma, ma-ma; 

oh, i think you are a darling.

mer-ry christ-mas! mer-ry christmas. 

here, wait for me. 

wind up the soldiers. then each dolly can have a partner.

 allow me.

allow me.

oh, i wish they were all alive.

     hickety, kickety, bees in a hive,
     witchery, twichery, you're alive.

 oh, lookee! candy!

candy.
